This is a small personal tool. In theory, it could contain tools for automating writing markdown, particularly github-interpereted markdown. 

In practice, the only planned feature for the moment is creating indexes. It will read through the file, note any headers, and create an index at the top of the file with internal links, github style of course.

I may add more, or I may never even complete this. Who knows?
